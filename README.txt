This project was my final project for CS3: Introduction to Software Design.
It was worked on with a group of 3 other people.
We recreated the mobile game Doodle Jump with our own custom themes and features
using the SDL library.

I contributed to many parts of this project, especially much of the basic
structs and game physics, but the following are parts that I worked on
exclusively myself:
- structs and files involving sprites (e.g. game_sprites.c, sprites.c, etc.)
and all code related to sprites in other areas of the project
- functions related to mouse events (e.g. game_mouse_click in game.c)
